Code and data for the manuscript titled "Individual behavioral variation does not affect social organization or reproductive success in a cooperative small mammal"

DESCRIPTION We studied the common degu, Octodon degus, a social and group-living rodent, to evaluate whether individual behavioral variation affects i) 
the composition of social groups, and ii) the reproductive success of individuals in groups. 
We identified several social groups in a population in central-north Chile, tested adults in an open field and poke test to quantify individual behavioral variation, 
determined assortment based on individual behavioral differences across social groups, and performed genetic analyses.
